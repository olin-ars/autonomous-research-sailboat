# oars_pkg: OARS' ROS package

`/ROSdemo` is a demo/brief tutorial to check that ROS works after setup, and to go through some of the steps of creating a new node.

`/msg` is a folder for custom message types for ROS.

`/nav_and_controls` is a folder for code having to do with planning and executing boat maneuvers.

`/sensing` is a folder for code to collect and interpret sensor data and publish it to ROS.

`boat_class.py` is a template file, which could give structure to code dealing with the boat's coordinated functioning. If you're working on that, you should figure out what structure you need, *and then* look at this file to see if it is useful to you.
